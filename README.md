# Transportes - Ayuntamiento de Madrid
In this project we are assuming a software developer role, that have to make some requested tasks from Ayuntamiento de Madrid IT department:

- They provide us raw data of EMT buses and BiciMAD bikes
- The program should be able to return information of any station, from whatever kind of transport they request
- The program must be fast, and should require the less possible dependences to run
- They want the code scalable. For example, to add more transports in the future (i.e. Metro de Madrid)
- The program should be able to return the distance between two stations, or between the user and any station

### Steps:

1. Look at the data to have a better understanding of the business
2. Clean the data based on the client requirements
3. Make a scalable Python structure, object-oriented based, with abstract methods
4. Code the program functionality
5. Make config files to structure the requests
6. Test the functionality
